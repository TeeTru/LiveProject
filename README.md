# Python Live Project
## Introduction
I created a Camping List Tracker App as an interactive website that allows the user to create multiple camping lists using Python and the Django and bootstrap Framework. I did this project over a course of two weeks broken up in one-week sprints and going through 10 User Stories using the AGILE/SCRUM methodology. Using the CRUD functionality I was able to create the app that allows the user to create a camping list, display the list, and an option to edit and delete. I used HTML and CSS to style the website and used the Pycharm IDE to write the code.
